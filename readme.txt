  In this project, I'll use JavaScript and TypeScript to create a webpage report which helps a potential researcher understand a week’s worth of Tweets from RunKeeper, a popular running app. 
  This project follow much of the methodology from one of Professor Daniel Epstein’s research papers, which looked to understand whether the content of RunKeeper tweets influences how or whether audience members respond.
